     <h1> b tag</h1>
     <p> The <b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b> for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the <strong> element to indicate that text is of special importance.</p>


        <h1>i tag</h1>
        <p>The <i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.</p>


            <h1> u tag</h1>
            <p>The <u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>


                <h1>select tag</h1>
                <p>The above example shows typical  usage. It is given an id attribute to enable it to be associated with a  for accessibility purposes, as well as a name attribute to represent the name of the associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by an  element nested inside the .

                    Each  element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. If no value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a selected attribute on an  element to make it selected by default when the page first loads.
                    
                    The  element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can be selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc.
                    
                    You can further nest elements inside  elements to create separate groups of options inside the dropdown.</p>

                    
                        
                    <h1>Button tag</h1>
                        <p>The  HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
                            By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
                            Try it</p>

                            <h1> hr tag</h1>
                            <p>The  HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section. Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS. </p>


                            <h1>  br tag</h1>

                            <p>The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant. As you can see from the above example, a  element is included at each point where we want the text to break. The text after the  begins again at the start of the next line of the text block.</p>
